In order to test the app properly, create a database 'chatify' in mysql and run the commands in the db.sql file.
Then, start the backend node server.
The Flutter app, when run locally, will be able to fetch from the backend server, which queries the mysql database for data.
The Flutter app is created with android devices in mind and tested with the pixel 3a (default emulator in android studio).
